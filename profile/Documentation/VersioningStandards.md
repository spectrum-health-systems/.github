# DEVELOPMENT NOTES - Versioning

> Last updated 1-27-23

Development versions of Abatab use [Symanic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with the format of X.Y.Z where:

* **`X`** is a the major version, and is based on the release year
* **`Y`** is a the minor version, and is based on the release month
* **`Z`** is a the patch version

For example, an Abatab release in May of 2023 would have a version of `23.5`
